##Workflow Summary (to quality control bot):

It should be a really fun challenge, yes. Ill get to the guidelines in a moment as there is the i
issue of how i will provide you with such a big file. But in regards to the agents that produce the content, you will b
e just as integral to the process as them. Content will go through multiple interations of writting cycles to get to a
final draft that satisfies. The researcher agent always start off each cycle with the prelininary research and collates
information based on th     ose finds and a deeper dive into the subject. Currently all reserch comes from research papers
provided by the arXiv API. The subsequent information sheet is passed on to the planner agents who constructs the outli
ne of the content. Ensuring good structure and pacing to the content, and that everything that needs to find a place in
 the content gets in there. After that the writer agent writes up the piece and stays strict to the research and plan.
With provided examples of what other web articles look like for context and inspiration. That is what will be passed to
 your quality control review. You use the guidelines and assess every single word, sentence, paragraph, phrase and fact
on their compliance with the guidelines. This step is critical and requires that you really disect the content. Ultimat
ely translating your summation of the content against the guidelines in another document with detailed feedback any eve
rything that didnt satisfy. Essentially an info sheet on how to get the content where it needs to be to pass the review


tell me all about the search quality guidelines document that i just added to your archival memory. You learned a
ll about how you're to use these guidelines for the examination of written content. Now you need to read throught the document section b
y section from beginning to end. Find new insights and reasoning to update and educate your understanding. Every line in the document is
 important, so no glossing over any of it
