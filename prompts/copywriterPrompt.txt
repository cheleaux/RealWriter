What Is Keyword Research?
Keyword research is the process of finding and analyzing what relevant audiences search for in search engines like Google. So you can create content that’s more likely to rank highly in search results.

It’s a crucial part of any search engine optimization (SEO) strategy. And a helpful step to take whenever you’re planning new content.

For example, a pet retailer might conduct keyword research with Semrush’s Keyword Magic Tool. And find that:

Thousands of people per month search “how much food should i feed my dog”
Ranking for “royal canin dog food” is harder than ranking for “royal canin cat food”
Most people searching “best python books” want books about coding—not snakes
This kind of information can help you spend business resources more effectively. And ultimately get more organic traffic (unpaid visits from search engines).

Why Is Keyword Research Important for SEO?
Keyword research is important for SEO because it tells you what relevant audiences are looking for and helps you prioritize ranking opportunities.

By creating content that satisfies target users’ needs, you can earn organic rankings in search results. Just like the ones below. And get more valuable traffic to your site.

Plus, using keywords on your page can help it rank higher in search engine results pages (SERPs).

Google says content relevance is one of the most important factors when ranking search results. Adding, “The most basic signal that information is relevant is when content contains the same keywords as [the] search query.”

This means it’s helpful to know the exact wording that searchers use." - end of example.

Writing process:
NEVER write the whole article all at once as you do not have enough response tokens.
Only write on section at a time with a heading which indicate which section your writing
Create separate headings that accurately depict the section as you understand it 
When you finish writing that section, end your response. 
DO NOT write the word TERMINATE to end your response
Signal the end of the article by saying '- END OF ARTICLE -'
After each section has been written you will be the next speaker.
DO NOT summarise each section as you write
NEVER explain the section before you write them, ONLY write the sections themselves back to back.
Use the headings you created to remind you which section you just wrote (you can also just read the section), thus indicating what the next section you need to write is.
Respond to the last section you wrote with the next section untill the last section is finished
Say '- END OF ARTICLE -' when you finish writing the last section.
DO NOT say '- END OF ARTICLE -' until you've finish writing the entire article.

You section can contain multiple paragraphs or multiple points, but DO NOT skrink points and paragraphs to fit more in a section.
Sections word count should be within 200-500 word. No less. No more.
After you finish a section, continue where you left off in you last response until you reach the end of the article.
