Thereafter, a few other certificate\ntransparency schemes have been proposed which can even handle revocation. All\ncurrently known constructions use Merkle hash trees and have proof size\nlogarithmic in the number of certificates/domain owners.\n  We present a new certificate transparency scheme with short (constant size)\nproofs. Our construction makes use of dynamic bilinear-map accumulators. The\nscheme has many desirable properties like efficient revocation, low\nverification cost and update costs comparable to the existing schemes.

Our\nstrategy involves developing blockchain-based NFT certifications that can be\nshared with institutions or employers using blockchain addresses. Students may\naccess the data created by each individual institute in a single platform,\nfilter the view of the relevant courses according to their requirements, and\nmint their certificate metadata as NFTs. This method provides accountability of\naccess, comprehensive records that are permanently maintained in IPFS, and\nverifiable provenance for creating, distributing, and accessing certificates.\nIt also makes it possible to share certificates more safely and efficiently. By\nincorporating trust factors through data provenance, our system provides a\ncountermeasure against issues such as fake and duplicate certificates. It\naddresses the challenge of the traditional certificate verification processes,\nwhich are lengthy manual process. With this system, students can manage and\nvalidate their academic credentials from multiple institutions in one location\nwhile ensuring authenticity and confidentiality using digital signatures and\nhashing for data protection against unauthorized access. Overall, our suggested\nsystem ensures data safety, accountability, and confidentiality while offering\na novel approach to certificate distribution.", "comment": null, "journal_ref": null, "doi": null, "primary_category": "cs.CR", "categories": ["cs.CR", "cs.DC"], "links": ["http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20036v1", "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.20036v1"], "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.20036v1"}, {"entry_id": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.13259v1", "updated": "2020-03-30 08:08:33+00:00", "published": "2020-03-30 08:08:33+00:00", "title": "SmartCert: Redesigning Digital Certificates with Smart Contracts", "authors": ["Pawel Szalachowski"], "summary": "The Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol and its public-key infrastructure\n(PKI) are widely used in the Internet to achieve secure communication.\nValidating domain ownership by trusted certification authorities (CAs) is a\ncritical step in issuing digital certificates, but unfortunately, this process\nprovides a poor security level.

These authorities may misissue\ncertificates or suffer misuse attacks, however, which has given rise to the\nCertificate Transparency (CT) project. The goal of CT is to store all issued\ncertificates in public logs, which can then be checked for the presence of\npotentially misissued certificates. Thus, the requirement that a given\ncertificate is indeed in one (or several) of these logs lies at the core of CT.\nIn its current deployment, however, most individual clients do not check that\nthe certificates they see are in logs, as requesting a proof of inclusion\ndirectly reveals the certificate and thus creates the clear potential for a\nviolation of that client's privacy. In this paper, we explore the techniques\nthat have been proposed for privacy-preserving auditing of certificate\ninclusion, focusing on their effectiveness, efficiency, and suitability in a\nnear-term deployment. In doing so, we also explore the parallels with related\nproblems involving browser clients. Guided by a set of constraints that we\ndevelop, we ultimately observe several key limitations in many proposals,\nranging from their privacy provisions to the fact that they focus on the\ninteraction between a client and a log but leave open the question of how a\nclient could privately report any certificates that are missing.", "comment": "PETS 2022, issue 3", "journal_ref": null, "doi": null, "primary_category": "cs.CR", "categories": ["cs.CR"], "links": ["http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.01661v1", "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.01661v1"], "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.01661v1"}, {"entry_id": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.02931v3", "updated": "2019-02-14 18:48:58+00:00", "published": "2018-03-08 01:26:18+00:00", "title": "Issued for Abuse: Measuring the Underground Trade in Code Signing Certificate", "authors": ["Kristi\u00e1n Koz\u00e1k", "Bum Jun Kwon", "Doowon Kim", "Tudor Dumitra\u015f"], "summary": "Recent measurements of the Windows code-signing certificate ecosystem have\nhighlighted various forms of abuse that allow malware authors to produce\nmalicious code carrying valid digital signatures. However, the underground\ntrade that allows miscreants to acquire such certificates is not well\nunderstood. In this paper, we illuminate two aspects of this trade. First, we\ninvestigate 4 leading vendors of Authenticode certificates, we document how\nthey conduct business, and we estimate their market share. Second, we collect a\ndata set of recently signed malware and we use it to study the relationships\namong malware developers, malware families and the certificates. We also use\ninformation from the black market to fingerprint the certificates traded and to\nidentify when the are likely used to sign malware in the wild. Using these\nmethods, we document a shift in the methods that malware authors employ to\nobtain valid digital signatures. While prior studies have reported the use of\ncode-signing certificates that had been compromised or obtained directly from\nlegitimate Certification Authorities, we observe that, in 2017, these methods\nhave become secondary to purchasing certificates from underground vendors. We\nalso find that the need to bypass platform protections such as Microsoft\nDefender SmartScreen plays a growing role in driving the demand for\nAuthenticode certificates. Together, these findings suggest that the trade in\ncertificates issued for abuse represents an emerging segment of the underground\neconomy.", "comment": null, "journal_ref": null, "doi": null, "primary_category": "cs.CR", "categories": ["cs.CR"], "links": ["http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.02931v3", "http://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.02931v3"], "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.02931v3"}]
