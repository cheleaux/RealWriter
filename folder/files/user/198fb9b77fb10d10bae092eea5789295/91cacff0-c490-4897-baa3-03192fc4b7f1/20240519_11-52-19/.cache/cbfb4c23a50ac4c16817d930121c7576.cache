With the increasing sophistication of the\ninternet and dependencies on internet data transmission, it has become vital to\nbe aware of various encryption technologies and trends. It can assist in\nsafeguarding private information and sensitive data, as well as improve the\nsecurity of client-server communication. Database encryption is a procedure\nthat employs an algorithm to convert data contained in a database into \"cipher\ntext,\" which is incomprehensible until decoded. Homomorphic encryption\ntechnology, which works with encrypted data, can be utilized in both symmetric\nand asymmetric systems. In this paper, we evaluated homomorphic encryption\ntechniques based on recent highly cited articles, as well as compared all\ndatabase encryption problems and developments since 2018. The benefits and\ndrawbacks of homomorphic approaches were examined over classic encryption\nmethods including Transparent Database Encryption, Column Level Encryption,\nField Level Encryption, File System Level Encryption, and Encrypting File\nSystem Encryption in this review. Additionally, popular databases that provide\nencryption services to their customers to protect their data are also examined.", "comment": "20 pages, 4 Figures", "journal_ref": null, "doi": null, "primary_category": "cs.CR", "categories": ["cs.CR"], "links": ["http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10028v1", "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.10028v1"], "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.10028v1"}, {"entry_id": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.09144v1", "updated": "2018-11-22 12:50:03+00:00", "published": "2018-11-22 12:50:03+00:00", "title": "PE-AONT: Partial Encryption combined with an All-or-Nothing Transform", "authors": ["Katarzyna Kapusta", "Gerard Memmi"], "summary": "In this report, we introduce PE-AONT: a novel algorithm for fast and secure\ndata fragmentation. Initial data are fragmented and only a selected subset of\nthe fragments is encrypted. Further, fragments are transformed using a\nvariation of an all-or-nothing transform that blends encrypted and\nnon-encrypted fragments. By encrypting data only partially, we achieve better\nperformance than relevant techniques including data encryption and\nstraightforward fragmentation.

To achieve high video\nsecurity, to the best of our knowledge, almost all of the existing HEVC\nencryption algorithms mainly encrypt the whole video, such that the user\nwithout permissions cannot obtain any viewable information. However, these\nencryption algorithms cannot meet the needs of customers who need part of the\ninformation but not the full information in the video. In many cases, such as\nprofessional paid videos or video meetings, users would like to observe some\nvisible information in the encrypted video of the original video to satisfy\ntheir requirements in daily life. Aiming at this demand, this paper proposes a\nmulti-level encryption scheme that is composed of lightweight encryption,\nmedium encryption and heavyweight encryption, where each encryption level can\nobtain a different amount of visual information. It is found that both\nencrypting the luma intraprediction model (IPM) and scrambling the syntax\nelement of the DCT coefficient sign can achieve the performance of a distorted\nvideo in which there is still residual visual information, while encrypting\nboth of them can implement the intensity of encryption and one cannot gain any\nvisual information. The experimental results meet our expectations\nappropriately, indicating that there is a different amount of visual\ninformation in each encryption level. Meanwhile, users can flexibly choose the\nencryption level according to their various requirements.", "comment": null, "journal_ref": null, "doi": null, "primary_category": "cs.MM", "categories": ["cs.MM", "cs.LG"], "links": ["http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.02620v1", "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.02620v1"], "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.02620v1"}, {"entry_id": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.08002v1", "updated": "2020-10-15 20:03:26+00:00", "published": "2020-10-15 20:03:26+00:00", "title": "Fully Homomorphic Encryption via Affine Automorphisms", "authors": ["Paul Hriljac"], "summary": "Homomorphic encryption is a method used in cryptopgraphy to create programs\nthat can interact with encrypted data without ever leaving the data in the\nclear.

The\nintroduction of quantum gates is a critical step for constructing the message\nencryption and the computation encryption within the framework. Of significance\nis that both encryptions are respectively accomplished in a multivariate\npolynomial set generated by quantum gates. Two fundamental traits of quantum\ngates, the invertibility and the noncommutativity, establish the success of\nEHE. The encrypted computation is exact because its encryption transformation\nis conducted with invertible gates. In the same vein, decryptions for both an\nencrypted message and encrypted computation are exact. The second trait of\nnoncommutativity among applied quantum gates brings forth the security for the\ntwo encryptions. Toward the message encryption, a plaintext is encoded into a\nciphertext via a polynomial set generated by a product of noncommuting gates\nrandomly chosen. In the computation encryption, a desired operation is encoded\ninto an encrypted polynomial set generated by another product of noncommuting\ngates. The encrypted computation is then the evaluation of the encrypted\npolynomial set on the ciphertext and is referred to as the cryptovaluation. EHE\nis not only attainable on quantum computers, but also straightforwardly\nrealizable on traditional computing environments. Surpassing the standard\nsecurity 2^128 of quantum resilience, both the encryptions further reach a\nsecurity greater than the suggested threshold 2^1024 and are characterized as\nhyper quantum-resilient. Thanks to the two essential traits of quantum gates,\nthis framework can be regarded as the initial tangible manifestation of the\nconcept noncommutative cryptography.", "comment": null, "journal_ref": null, "doi": null, "primary_category": "quant-ph", "categories": ["quant-ph", "cs.CR"], "links": ["http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09027v3", "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.09027v3"], "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.09027v3"}]
