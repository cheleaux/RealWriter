The business transactions over\nwireless electronic devices are not secure and hence the messages are prone to\nbe intercepted and modified by an intruder. So, devices supporting wireless\ninternet must be guaranteed at the same level of security as the wired network.\nPKI (Public Key Infrastructure) used in the wired environment is not suitable\nfor wireless environment because of the less powerful processor and small\nmemory. This arises a need for the development of a Wireless Public Key\nInfrastructure (WPKI) that provides the similar security level as the wired PKI\nsuitable for mobile phone. In this paper, a discussion of public key\ninfrastructure and an experimental set up for Wireless Public key\nInfrastructure for mobile phones are made.", "comment": null, "journal_ref": null, "doi": null, "primary_category": "cs.CR", "categories": ["cs.CR"], "links": ["http://arxiv.org/abs/1212.2563v1", "http://arxiv.org/pdf/1212.2563v1"], "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/1212.2563v1"}, {"entry_id": "http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0411066v1", "updated": "2004-11-18 19:00:35+00:00", "published": "2004-11-18 19:00:35+00:00", "title": "Using LDAP Directories for Management of PKI Processes", "authors": ["V.

Security of SIP is\nan important consideration for VoIP communication as the traffic is transmitted\nover the insecure IP network. And the authentication process in SIP ranges from\npre-shared secret based solutions to Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) based\nsolution. However, due to the limitations in PKI based solutions, some PKI less\nauthentications mechanisms are proposed. This paper aims to present an overview\nof different authentication methods used in or together with SIP.

Using PKI\n(Public Key Infrastructure), a trusted entity can produce a digital signature,\nverifying the authenticity of the public key. However, what happens when\nexternal entities are not trusted to verify the public key or in cases where\nthere is no Internet connection within an isolated or autonomously acting\ncollection of devices? For this, a trusted entity can be elected to generate a\nkey pair and then split the private key amongst trusted devices. Each node can\nthen sign part of the transaction using their split of the shared secret. The\naggregated signature can then define agreement on a consensus within the\ninfrastructure. Unfortunately, this process has two significant problems. The\nfirst is when no trusted node can act as a dealer of the shares. The second is\nthe difficulty of scaling the digital signature scheme. This paper outlines a\nmethod of creating a leaderless approach to defining trust domains to overcome\nweaknesses in the scaling of the elliptic curve digital signature algorithm.\nInstead, it proposes the usage of the Edwards curve digital signature algorithm\nfor the definition of multiple trust zones. The paper shows that the\ncomputational overhead of the distributed key generation phase increases with\nthe number of nodes in the trust domain but that the distributed signing has a\nrelatively constant computational overhead.", "comment": null, "journal_ref": null, "doi": null, "primary_category": "cs.CR", "categories": ["cs.CR"], "links": ["http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04898v2", "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.04898v2"], "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.04898v2"}]
